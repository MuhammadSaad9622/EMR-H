***ASSESSMENT AND PLAN***
***Treatment Plans/Rationale*** 
â¢	See diagnosis for assessment. 
â¢	The patient's overall condition: remains status post injury. 
â¢	Rationale for exam: Rule out contraindications for manipulation to the lumbar spine, the wrist and the knee. Rule out contraindications for physical modalities and procedures to the the lumbar spine, the wrist, and the knee. 
â¢	Rationale for treatment and treatment objectives: The short-term goals are to decrease level of acute pain, decrease the inflammation, decrease the swelling, and improve the patient P.R.O.M. The long-term goals are to decrease the likelihood of further joint damage, decrease the level of chronic pain, and educate the patient in techniques to prevent further re-injury, improve overall function of the affected areas, and improve the joint mobilization of the affected areas.

â¢	Palpations. Moderate to severe spasm of the paralumbar muscles. 
â¢	Range of Motions. thoracolumbar spine ROM. Increased ROM noted.  Left knee ROM. Same ROM noted. Right knee ROM. Increased ROM noted 

***ASSESSMENT AND PLAN***
***Treatment***
**Chiropractic and Acupuncture** 
â¢	Specific adjustive procedures and acupuncture administered to: the lumbar spine, the knee, and wrist. 

**Physical Modalities**
The following modalities were utilized in the treatment of this patient and applied to:  
muscles of the posterior neck and the lumbar spine, wrist, and knees.  
â¢	Hot and cold packs 
â¢	Mechanical traction 
â¢	Myofascial release  
â¢	Ultrasound 
â¢	Infrared  
â¢	Electrical muscle stimulation 
â¢	Therapeutic exercise  
 
 ***Treatment Plans/Rationale*** 
â¢	See diagnosis for assessment. 
â¢	Schedule of care: The patient will be treated with acupuncture and chiropractic specific manipulative procedures to the lumbar spine, wrists, and knee.  
â¢	The patient will receive physical modalities to the muscles of the posterior neck and the muscles of the lumbar spine, wrists, and knee.  
â¢	Patient states that therapy is helping to decrease pain. However, she states that prolonged sitting, and bending exacerbates pain in the lumbar spine. Prolonged weight bearing activity and walking exacerbate pain in the knees. 
â¢	Reevaluation: A re-evaluation will be performed and consist of the following: a reexamination of the positive objective findings and reevaluation will be in approximately 4 weeks. 
â¢	Return 3 times per week for 4 weeks.

***OBJECTIVE***
***Examination***
**Musculoskeletal** 
â¢	Orthopedic Tests. Kemps test â positive lumbar spine. P to A spring test â positive in lumbar spine. McMurray's â positive in the left knee.  
â¢	Palpations. Spasm of paralumbar muscles, and the quadratus lumborum. 
â¢	Range of Motions. Lumbar spine ROM. 80% pre-injury status. Left knee ROM. 85% pre-injury status. 

***ASSESSMENT AND PLAN***
***Treatment Plans/Rationale*** 
â¢	See diagnosis for assessment. 
â¢	Prognosis: Guarded. 
â¢	The patient has reached a plateau in her recovery. She remains symptomatic due to the extensive injuries sustained. Prolonged twisting, and bending exacerbate pain in the lumbar spine. Prolonged bending and walking exacerbates pain in the left knee 
â¢	Computerized Radiographic Mensuration Analysis (CRMA). I have gone over the results with my patient. The results show lumbar spine instability.  
â¢	Provided home ligament strengthening program. 
â¢	Patient will be discharged from our care. 
 
 
 	 
***Frequency of Treatment Guideline Placement*** 
For our patient who experienced an auto collision as their mechanism of injury, we will follow the croft treatment guidelines, as indicated in the Croft Treatment Guidelines, ICA Best Practices and the California Whiplash Guidelines IV. Motor Vehicle Accidents (MVAs) ICA decided to use the long-established Croft Cervical 
Acceleration/Deceleration (CAD) Guidelines for its basic Frequency and Duration Programs of Care for MVA victims. When developing her guidelines, Croft incorporated the stages of tissue repair. The stages of injury repair are defined in Table 14, Chapter 11 of the original guideline document. In MVAs, Croft originated 5 grades of injury during CAD and these Grades have been universally accepted in the literature.  
This patient most closely falls into a Grade 2: As they show: Limitation of range of motion and some ligamentous injury.  This allocates a treatment duration of up to 56 weeks and a treatment total number up to 76 sessions. 
 
 
***AMA Guidelines 5th Edition for Impairment*** 
             **Lumbar** 
Table 15-5 Criteria for Rating Impairment Due to Cervical Spine Injury: (Page 392) 
With disc pathology and ligament instability findings this injury is rated at a Category II yielding an impairment estimate based on physical examination findings and film forensics at  8% whole person impairment 
 
 
 
***Miscellaneous Notes***
**Future Medical Care** 
â¢	In view of Mrs. Rodriguezs' history of injury and mechanism of injury as well as present complaints and clinical findings, it is my opinion that the patient's symptoms are the result of the motor vehicular accident that occurred on October 03, 2020.  Following a thorough examination, she was placed on a conservative treatment program as mentioned above. In light of her level of initial subjective complaints, her complaints were consistent with her objective findings and this remained consistent with each office visit thereafter. Over the course of treatment, there was a gradual reduction of subjective complaints and improved objective factors. Mrs. Rodriguez states the treatments were helpful. 
 
It is my opinion that the patient may need future medical care on a PRN basis for control of the pain syndrome. Such medical care may include, but is not limited to, the following: Chiropractic manipulative therapy, acupuncture, physiotherapy modalities and analgesics for relief of the pain syndrome. It is estimated that 12-36 visits per year may be necessary at a cost of $100-$120 per visit. 
 
The following requested cost estimates are based upon those published in the 2003 Medical Fees in the United States, using the GAF for Anaheim/Santa Ana, published by PMIC, ISBN 1-57066-264-9. 
 
â¢	The above report is for assessment of the possible injuries the patient might have incurred and is not to be construed as a complete physical examination for general health purposes.
